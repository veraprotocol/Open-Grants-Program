# Open Grant Proposal


* **Project Name:** Vera Defi Phase 1
* **Team Name:** Team Vera
* **Payment Address:** 0x94637b309B477388656B06f86A2604D202123583

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
Vera DeFi is a key component of Vera Protocol, a larger vision to build an open protocol that enables the peer-to-peer lending, borrowing and exchange of physical assets on the blockchain by leveraging hash signatures of object scan,  NFC smart tags and decentralized oracles. As a Substrate-based lending application, Vera DeFi smart contracts will manage unique asset identities, interest, and payment, enabling users to loan assets for token payout.

  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  Core Smart contract components will be developed in Ink on substrate. We will research integrating oracles like paralink. 
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
  Like how Bitcoin and Ethereum have enabled trustless peer-to-peer payments of digital assets between strangers, our vision is to enable the trustless retail or exchange of physical goods and assets between strangers without reliance on a centralized marketplace. In light of recent censorships taken by Big Tech oligopolies, our mission is to be an alternative platform for decentralized, censorship-resistant digital commerce and DeFi applications for real-world assets and physical consumer goods. The Vera team looks forward to working closely with its community to build an ecosystem that empowers and rewards entrepreneurs, inventors, and producers of consumer goods and protect the fundamental human right to buy, sell, or trade property we create and own.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 1. | AssetManager | WContinue the development of our PoC AssetManager contract in Ink to enhance the functionality to fully support the first phase of the user interface. |  
| 2. | UI/Design | Design UI based on the phase 
[wireframe](https://balsamiq.cloud/sa6mpd1/pvn6rks/r5D27). |  
| 3. |User Interface | Build the UI on top of the smart contract functionalities and  based on the design |  
| 4. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of the application |  
| 5. | Article | We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant. |



## Future Plans
* Research and implement oracle integration
* Integration with physical devices to authenticate physical objects
* Build more sophisticated decentralized market place

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:
